## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is a resource for parents, teachers and students for executive function, stratagies and possible interventions.
The heart of this web app is a database that that holds information for common executive function.
Users will be able to search for strategies, login, post comments, access intervention plans that branch off depending on the response and interact with others. 
They will also be able to find resources for more advanced topics within executive function.
